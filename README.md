## A lab for unit testing in Python

We want the code in `cap.py` to take a string and capitalize the first letter
in each word in the string.

Based on this problem specification, add two more unit tests to `test.py`.

And try this workflow
    * Run `tests.py` 
    * Observe the failures/errors
    * Modify the code in `cap.py` to address the error
    * (repeat)
